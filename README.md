## Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It operates in three cities: Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodra. The company aims to expand to other metro/tier-1 cities within the next two years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing issues where key customers have not renewed their annual contracts due to service-level concerns. The management suspects that essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full, which has impacted customer satisfaction. To address this, the management requested the supply chain analytics team to monitor On-Time (OT), In-Full (IF), and On-Time In-Full (OTIF) delivery metrics daily.

## Task List

As the data analyst on this project, I undertook the following:

- Defined key metrics: OT%, IF%, OTIF%, LIFR, VOFR
- Built a clean data model
- Created an interactive Power BI dashboard
- Derived actionable insights and recommendations

## Key Insights & Recommendations

- **All Key Metrics (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) are below target** â€” A strong focus on logistics and production planning is required.
- **Average Delay** â€” Orders are delayed by approximately 0.42 days.
- **Top Customers Facing Delays:** Lotus Mart, Coolblue, and Acclaimed Stores. Potential root causes: unrealistic delivery commitments or unexpected high order volumes.
- **Top Products with Frequent Delays:** Ghee, Curd, and Butter. Inventory or production challenges need to be addressed.
- **Trend Observation:** No significant improvements have been seen over recent months â€” ongoing review meetings and root cause analysis are recommended.
- **Low LIFR (66%)** â€” Strengthening inventory and replenishment systems will help.
